# Scrumboad_Django-App

This is a Scrumboard App made using Django and Angular Js
It's similar to Trello but it's just basics 

Allows user to login and register.
Allows user to create crud operations on a card e.g create, update, delete and read.
Also allows you to move card back and fourth either : Todo - Doing - Done.

User also has a profile where the are able to update profile.

Since django allows you to have super user while building the app, we also have one for the admin dashboard.
